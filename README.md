# MusicByCountry

WorldTune is a redefined music application. It streams the most popular songs in a country. The songs update every 24 hours.
It is the brainchild of Rahul Mittal who came up with this idea of streaming music, sorting it specifically country wise.
The project was created during HackGT by Rahul Mittal, Thor Keller and Jerry Chang. While Jerry designed the interface, Rahul worked in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to make the front end interactive and user-friendly. Thor handled the backend, using PHP and Java to scrape the web for the most popular songs.
